<p>I am a postdoc at Language Technology Group, Universität Hamburg hosted by <a href="https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/people/chris-biemann.html">Chris Biemann</a>.</p>
<p>I have got my PhD in Computer Science at Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology in 2022. I worked on the Taxonomy Enrichment task under the supervision of <a href="https://faculty.skoltech.ru/people/alexanderpanchenko">Alexander Panchenko</a>.</p>
<p>My research interests include Taxonomies, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Question Answering, and NLP in application to Linguistics. Currently, I am interested in NLP for Low-Resource Languages.</p>
